Engineering stands to be one of several fundamental passions of mine due nearly entirely to its demand of demonstration of understanding. To incarnate creative impulses through technology to yield quantifiable and qualifiable results to benefit others and self is truly the only meaningful and truly communicable mastery of a given principle.

I seek to find roles in which I may endeavor in creative and innovative capacities greater than what I can accomplish with but only my own resources and knowledge.
I work to find the current bleeding edge of human technology and understanding to then be able to innovate and push that edge.
I continue to believe that the forefront of advanced engineering houses the greatest potential for human endeavor.

John 9:39 

Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”
