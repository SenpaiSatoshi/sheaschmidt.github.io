Presented below is the report I created to summarize my investigation of hydrogen peroxide and kerosene liquid fuel combustion as a source of propulsion in order to satisfy the requirements of my STEM Academy Capstone Project at Lutheran High School Parker.

Check out some video footage of a live-fire test using "R-Candy."
