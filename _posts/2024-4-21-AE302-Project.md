Showcased below is the data package relating to the 3D model of a North American P51 Mustang Type D my team and I created to demonstrate our understanding of Generative Shape Design (GSD), drafting, and schematic comprehension as part of our CatiaV5 course completion. Using this model and the outer mold line (OML) created, our team was also able to wood cut and assemble a scale quasi-3D model, as well as print a scale 3D model out of PLA on university 3D printers.

Included below is the image set of the CAD renders and the slide deck used to present our process.
