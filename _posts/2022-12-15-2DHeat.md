The videos below are some simulations produced by my MATLAB program I describe in the paper at the bottom.

Each of these test cases showcase the evolution of the heatmap of a 2-Dimensional uniform sheet under different starting conditions as well as persistent ambient heating and cooling effects,

The model relies on a cell based discretization of the partial differential equation that describes heat (aptly named the heat equation).

Here is the report I created to showcase and communicate the details of the program and how it approximates the underlying mathematical model:
